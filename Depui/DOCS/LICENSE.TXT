Introduction:

  DEPUI is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may
  contain, in addition  to the  DEPUI gui  engine, various tools and
  contributions which rely on, or relate to, DEPUI.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects thus the DEPUI engine, the test programs, documentation
  and makefiles, at the very least.

  This license was inspired by the Freetype, BSD, Artistic  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that  this software works.  However, we'll be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. ("as is" distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. ("royalty-free" usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in your  documentation  that you've used the  DEPUI
      code. ("credits").

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products,
  provided that all warranty or  liability claims are assumed by the
  product vendor.



Legal Terms:


0.Definitions:

  Throughout this license,  the terms "package", "DEPUI", and "DEPUI
  archive" refer  to  the  set  of files  originally distributed  by
  the  author (Doug Eleveld) as the "DEPUI", be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  "You" refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  "using" is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  "program" or "executable".
  This program is referred to as "a program using the DEPUI engine".

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  DEPUI   archive,   including  all  source   code,   binaries   and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  DEPUI is copyright (C) 2000 by Doug Eleveld.  All rights  reserved
  except as specified below.

  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept it.  However, as DEPUI  is copyrighted  material, only this
  license, or  another one contracted  with the  authors, grants you
  the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore,  by using,
  distributing, or modifying DEPUI, you indicate that you understand
  and accept all the terms of this license.

    o Redistribution  in binary form must provide  a disclaimer that

      encourage you  to  put an URL  to  the DEPUI  web page in your
