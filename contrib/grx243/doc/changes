-------------------------------------------------------------------

Date     Changes

01/06/28 ----------- GRX v2.4.3 released (Mariano Alvarez Fernandez)
01/06/27 Added new targets to makefiles: install-bin, uninstall-bin,
         install-fonts and uninstall-fonts (readme file updated)
01/06/26 Moved bin2c, fnt2c, vesainfo, lfbinfo and modetest to
         src/utilprog. They are build in the source makefile.
01/06/22 Except for the w32 version the install target installs the
         info manual. As suggested by Maurice Lombardi and Waldemar
         Schultz
01/06/21 pngtest test program added. It works too without png support
         and shows a message
01/06/20 Changed BCCGRX cleardevice function to clear the screen to
         the current BACKGROUND color instead of black. Suggested by
         Waldemar Schultz
01/06/19 ctx2png functions (GrSaveContextToPng, GrLoadContextFromPng,
         GrQueryPng, GrPngSupport) integrated in GRX. src/pnm subdir
         renamed to src/gformats. Added dummy functions if there isn't
         png support
01/06/18 New API functions: GrLoadContextFromPnmBuffer and
         GrQueryPnmBuffer

01/06/15 ----------- GRX v2.4.2 released (Mariano Alvarez Fernandez)
01/06/12 Modified win32 input code to work GrMouseGetEvent and
         GrKeyRead at the same time when GrMouseEventEnable(1,0) is set
01/06/07 Merged makedefs.gnu, makedefs.x11, makedefs.dj2 and
         makedefs.w32 in makedefs.grx (readme file updated)
01/06/06 Now we can use "GRXMain" for all GRX versions, grx20.h defines
         it like "main" except for the win32 version. Deleted the ugly
         "#ifdef __WIN32__ ..." in test programs (except for BGI tests)
01/06/05 Added the Linux framebuffer videodriver (vdrivers/vd_lnxfb.c)
         alpha stage, only in 16 or 24 bpp. To use it set GRX20DRV to
         "linuxfb" in the GRX Linux version. The mouse doesn't work
01/06/05 Some minimal changes to compile ok with gcc 2.96 and
         Linux 2.4.x
01/05/30 Applied patch to sanity bgi code for gcc 3.0, by Andris
         Pavenis
01/05/28 Modified makefiles for linux and x11. Now they build
         shared and static libs at the same time. Added install and
         uninstall targets.
01/05/16 Applied patch to add standard pascal makefiles for dj2, w32,
         x11 and lnx. pascal/bgi/test and pascal/bgi/demo merged in
         pascal/bgi. Pascal readme updated. By Maurice Lombardi
01/05/09 Applied patch to produce makefiles for mingw32 pascal tests
         by Maurice Lombardi

01/03/26 Fixed a bug in pnm/ctx2pnm.c, when grx == NULL the actual context
         must be used. Reported by Vicente Fuentes Gea
01/03/25 The dj2 version uses now "uclock" in mouse/input.h to get 1ms
         resolution in input code. Because "uclock" can be unsafe in W3.1
         when NO_REPROGRAM_TIMER is defined the old code is used. A
         comment has been added to makedefs.dj2
01/03/25 Changed CLOCKS_PER_SECOND by CLK_TCK for linux in mouse/input.h
         to get real ticks per second

	 Fixed dynamic memory allocation bugs im image code.
	 GrImageStretch() now uses _GrFrDrvGenericStretchBlt()
98/04/30 Pascal definition for GrGetLibrarySystem
	 Changed VBE2 memory mapped IO support so a buggy BIOS
	   won't break the code that easily
98/04/28 Pattern filling uses predefined _GrPatternFiller instead
	   of local initialized var
	 S3 drivers banking functions enhanced
	 Unified DJGPP & Watcom VBE2 code
98/04/27 Fixed problems in font loading code on big endian systems
	 Updated Watcom support
	 Again eliminated some empty macro args
	 Added GrGetLibrarySystem() returning GRX_VERSION for

	   to (unsigned) int of assigned variables.
	 Fixed some bugs Thomas found in the ALPHA code
	 Changed temp. memory allocation. New function ALLOC()
	   will use malloc if SMALL_STACK defined of alloca otherwise.
	 Watcom assembler code didn't work. Changed the #pragma
	   definitions so they don't use macros.
	 Fixed several minor bugs
98/04/13 Fixed minor bugs in X11 driver.
98/04/06 Checked GNU-Pascal support (basic functions only)
98/04/05 Minor bugfixes and some GCC/386 speedups (copy & fill
	 loops aligned on 16byte boundary for optimal performance)
	 Changed the mouse timing information to real world time
	 instead of user process time (X11 & Linux)
	 GrMouseGetEventT will only return a valid ev.dtime if
	 any event occured
98/04/02 Faster VGA8X line drawing

	 - LFB24 and RAM24 now use the same code.
	 - Optimization for black/grey/white filling: done by repfill_b
	 Fixed some Linux/386 shared lib problems (can't use EBX with -fPIC)
98/03/17 Major code rearrangement: (Watcom port may be broken :((
	 - A lot of frame driver now share code and use much
	   more optimized (!= generic) drawing functions
	 - Generic and asm fwdcopy/revcopy functions for blitting
	 - splitted header files to individual system files
	   (filling, copying, ...) for better maintaince and
	   easier optimization
